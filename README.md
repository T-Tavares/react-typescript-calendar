# React & Typescript Calendar

I've built this calendar as a follow-up project for my article on how to build a calendar from scratch with TypeScript and React. For a while, I've wanted to write articles and give back to the community some of what I've learned. This project is the starting point of that journey.

The code in this project may have a few minor differences from the article, mainly small CSS adjustments that won't affect the functionality or overall appearance of the calendar.

To simplify the deployment and setup process, I used the T3 Stack.
